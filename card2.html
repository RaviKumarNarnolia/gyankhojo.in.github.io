    <h2>Anger of China on Elon Musk</h2>
    <p>Recently we have seen there has been anger and hatred spreading against the
      SpaceX owner Elon Musk on chinese social media. Even chinese government criticized and complained against Elon
      Musk to United Nations. </p>
    <p>The reason of Communist Party of China is giving that there was a near mess of Chinese space station with
      SpaceX's satellite. We need to know that Chinese space station is yet to be completed but major process of this
      has been done . The main modules of the space station has been already sent into space and China claims that the
      space station will run on full fledge after 2022. </p>
    <p>There was extremely near encounter with the Starlink satellites and seeing the urgency of the matter, the Chinese
      space agency was forced to move a bit. If they didn't moved that, space station worth Billions of Dollar just
      collapsed in the encounter. According to reports, the TIANGONG space station of China was worth 15 Billion Dollar.
      Now the Chinese citizens are genuinely thinking that the money for which they are buying Tesla cars, is directly
      put into the Starlink project of SpaceX, which harms Chinese interest in space. </p>
    <p>Now, there is a wave against Elon Musk in China saying- "Why can't we simply boycott Elon Musk by not purchasing
      his products.</p>
    <p>Let's think of matter neutrally, China is not wrong fully because in the coming few years, Elon Musk's project
      Starlink will have around 4200 satellites in space and will totally change the map of Earth's space.</p>
    <p>Now, let's see globally, there are around 6542 satellites orbiting the Earth as of 1 January, 2021. Out of which
      3372 satellites are active and 3170 satellites are inactive.</p>
    <h5>Plans of Elon Musk</h5>
    <p>SpaceX is going to multiply the global satellite number with almost 6 to 7 times on the name of good speed
      internet all over the planet. And with the huge number of satellites, there will be more space accidents.</p>
    <p>Although SpaceX claims the Starlink project, a very safe and secure and the satellites are made with autonomous
      collision avoidance but this is not the case in reality. And his satellite can do a big damage in future to
      International space station, Chinese space station, Indian space station and any other country's space station or
      satellites.</p>
    <h5>Now whats the solution</h5>
    <p>The need in the recent times is, India, China and the various other countries which are trying to launch their
      satellites and space stations should come together and raise the issue in UN so that proper law on the regulations
      of space satellites can be made in order to avoid the future encounters like this happened recently.</p>
    <p>Though Elon Musk nd USA enjoy a lot of soft power around the world and no one is there to say them anything
      regarding any issue But the time has come to regulate many issues & this is one.</p>
    <p>Humanity is already facing lot of problems on Earth like pollution & Climate change and now the tensions are
      rising in space also and by doing all that we are just putting our existence in a question mark?</p>
